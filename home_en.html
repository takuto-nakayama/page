    <h1>Research Interest</h1>
    <p>
      My major interest is what distinguishes a theoretically possible and impossible language. In the present days, it is said that there are thounsands of languages spoken on the Earth, and they are astonishingly divergent. On the other hand, there might be also "impossible" languages that are not included in such divergence. Then, what is the qualitative difference between them? As one of the approaches to my research interest, recently, I have been working on a topic of linguistic complexity .
    </p>
    <p>
      Linguistists have generally accepted the statement, "any langauge is not simpler or more complex than another but equally complex," which is called equi-complexity of language. In fact, it has been reported that when two languages are compared, one of the langauges are sometimes more complex in a subdomain, say morphology; the other one is more complex in another subdomain, say syntax. However, no one has not yet been verified whether the equi-complexity of language is true or not, which some linguists have begun to study after the end of 20th century, when technical issues started to be solved. As the first point of my research, I'm working on proposing a measuring method of complexity of languages, especially based on information theory as my first goal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, after all the technical problems are solved and the measuring method is established, does it mean the end of the discussion on the equi-complexity of language? I don't think so because the answer that is given by such a process only tells us about the equi-compelxity of all the "existing" languages. Thus, my second goal is to research the equi-complexity of language with considering theoretically possible languages not only existing ones.
